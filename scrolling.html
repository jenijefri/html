  <p>Welcome messages for customers are mostly used by businesses to say hello to their target audience, new users, and returning customers.
     They can also serve other purposes like showcasing a value proposition, generating quality leads, 
     moving shoppers down the sales funnel, and turning a new user into your brand ambassador on day one.

A welcome letter to a customer can be set up in multiple ways and sent through different channels.
